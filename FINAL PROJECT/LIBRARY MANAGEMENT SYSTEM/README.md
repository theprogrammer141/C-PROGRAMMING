# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN C-LANGUAGE
#This project is about developing a menu-driven library management system.
<br>
#In this project, I used a basic and structural approach.
<br>
#The whole functionality is ruled by divide and conquer method.
<br>
#Both Basic and complex principles of C-language are used.
<br>
<br>
#Defined a structure first
<br>
#Named it book
<br>
#Contains six elements
<br>
#Structure variable declared right after so that it will be visible to all functions
<br>
<br>
#Declared function prototypes
<br>
#About 9 functions in total

<br>
#The main function
<br>
#Will represent the functions available to be performed
<br>
#Contains loops,switch case and if-else statements according to need
