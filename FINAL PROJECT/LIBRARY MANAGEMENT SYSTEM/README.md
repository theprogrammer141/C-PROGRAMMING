# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN C-LANGUAGE
#This project is about developing a menu-driven library management system.
#In this project, I used a basic and structural approach.
#The whole functionality is ruled by divide and conquer method.
#Both Basic and complex principles of C-language are used.

#Defined a structure first
#Named it book
#Contains six elements
#Structure variable declared right after so that it will be visible to all functions
